# Environments
These are the `conda` environments that I've used to run the notebooks.
1. `cpu_environment.yml` contains the environment I used to run the notebooks on my laptop, which doesn't have a gpu.
2. `gpu_environment.yml` contains the environment I used to run the notebooks on my desktop, which **does** have a gpu.
